The author proposes dividing these opportunities into four strands: meaning-focused input, meaning-focused output, language-focused learning, and fluency development. Each strand provides a specific type of learning experience, and a well-designed course should have roughly equal amounts of time dedicated to each strand.\n\nThe author justifies the four strands based on research findings, including the input hypothesis, extensive reading, output hypothesis, form-focused instruction, and development of speaking and reading fluency. These principles provide a framework for managing innovation in language courses and ensuring that learners have access to a balanced range of learning opportunities.\n\nThe author also suggests that the time given to each strand could change as learners' proficiency develops, with more emphasis on fluency development at higher proficiency levels. However, the author argues that it is important to develop fluency skills from the beginning of language learning and to include learning about the nature of language, such as its history, etymology, and pragmatic effects, at advanced levels.\n\nOverall, the article provides a useful framework for organizing language learning opportunities and ensuring that learners have access to a balanced range of experiences that support their language acquisition."},{"role":"USER","content":"summarize 2007 four strands pdf"},{"role":"GPT","content":"The paper \"The Four Strands\" by Paul Nation discusses the concept of dividing language learning opportunities into four strands: meaning-focused input, meaning-focused output, language-focused learning, and fluency development. The author argues that a well-designed language course should have an even balance of these strands to provide learners with a comprehensive language learning experience.\n\nThe four strands are:\n\n1. Meaning-focused input: This involves exposure to language in context, with a focus on understanding the meaning of words and phrases.\n2. Meaning-focused output: This involves learners producing language in response to a prompt or task, with a focus on expressing their own ideas and thoughts.\n3. Language-focused learning: This involves learners engaging in activities that target specific language structures or skills, such as grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation.\n4. Fluency development: This involves learners practicing language tasks at a speed and complexity that allows for smooth and effortless production of language.\n\nThe author suggests that the time given to each strand could change as learners' proficiency develops, with more emphasis on fluency development at higher proficiency levels. However, the author is not in favor of this approach, arguing that developing fluency with items like numbers and useful multiword phrases should be a priority from the beginning of language learning, and that learning about the nature of language can also be a valuable support for advanced learners.\n\nThe paper concludes with ten pedagogical principles based on the four strands, which can guide language teaching practices. These principles emphasize the importance of providing learners with a balance of opportunities for learning, as well as the need to tailor instruction to individual learners' needs and abilities."}]
