Enterprise Knowledge Management with AI-Powered Knowledge Tables
What is Enterprise Knowledge Management (EKM)?
Enterprise Knowledge Management (EKM) refers to the systematic organization, storage, retrieval, and sharing of knowledge within an organization. 
It ensures that employees can efficiently access relevant information, improving productivity, decision-making, and collaboration.

Traditional EKM systems often rely on static databases, wikis, or document repositories. However, AI-powered knowledge tables introduce automation, smart retrieval, and dynamic recommendations, making knowledge management faster, smarter, and more efficient.
